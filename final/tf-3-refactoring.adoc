This post applies equally to OpenTofu and Terraform.

So you have created several resources, and you have noticed a pattern emerging, but refactoring your codebase means renaming resources or extracting code into its own module.
In TF (ToFu/TerraForm), changing the identifier of a resource means destroying and recreating it.
Here are some tips and tricks on how to refactor a Terraform code base.

== The basics

Really there are only two core commands `tofu state mv my_resource.old_name module.pattern.my_resource.new_name` and `tofu state import`

== The ergonomic workflow
